Week 4 - Preparation of Text and Speech for Machine Learning
------------------------------------------------------------

In which we look at how to prepare text and speech materials to make them compatible with machine learning approaches to classification and regression.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of the session the student will be able to:

*   describe typical pre-processing steps used to generate numerical coding of text
*   describe processes of tokenisation, normalisation applied to word tokens
*   explain how words can be described in terms of one-hot vectors
*   explain how documents can be encoded as bags of words
*   describe how a DNN can be applied to document classification
*   describe typical pre-processing steps used to generate numerical coding of speech recordings
*   explain how spoken utterances can be described a series of short-time signals analyses
*   explain how spoken utterances can be encoded as a fixed length vector
*   describe how a DNN can be applied to spoken utterance classification
*   describe how a DNN can be applied to spoken utterance regression
*   use the Keras toolkit to implement, train and test DNN models for text and speech problems

### Outline

1.  Data preparation for machine learning
2.  Text preparation steps: tokenisation, stop-word removal, normalisation, dictioary building
3.  One-hot vectors for words
4.  Bag-of-words model for documents
5.  Apply DNN classification to text
6.  Speech preparation steps: recording and segmentation, equalisation, short-time analysis
7.  Summarising spoken utterance into fixed length vector
8.  Apply DNN classification to speech
9.  Apply DNN regression to speech
