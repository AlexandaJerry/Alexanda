Week 10 - Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence
---------------------------------------------------

In which discuss the current deficiencies of deep learning for NLP, and the challenges to the creation of a human-level artificial intelligence.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of the session the student will be able to:

*   describe how artificially intelligent systems may add to human problem-solving abilities
*   describe the limitations of machine learning for understanding human cognition
*   discuss some current deficiencies of deep learning with respect to speech and language processing
*   outline the philosophical argument against the possibility that artefacts can understand language
*   discuss how embodied learning agents might acquire semantics
*   outline key ethical concerns about AI applications in the modern world

### Outline

1.  Goals of artificial intelligence
2.  Contribution of deep learning to cognitive science
3.  Deficiencies of deep learning for speech and language processing
4.  The Chinese Room argument for the fundamental limitation of strong AI and its counter-arguments
5.  Viewing prediction as modelling and future intelligent systems
6.  Ethics of applying deep learning to real-world problems

### Research Paper of the Week

*   R. Cicky, D. Kaiser, [Deep Neural Networks as Scientific Models](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(19)30034-8), Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Opinion, 23 (2019).

### Web Resources

*   [John Searle: Minds, Brains and Science](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00gq1fk/episodes/player) 1984 Reith Lectures. The Week 2 Lecture on "Beer cans and meat machines" is particularly relevant (and very entertaining).

### Readings

Be sure to read one or more of these discussions of the relationship between deep learning and cognitive science

*   [The chinese room argument](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/), Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.
*   [Learning Cognitive Models using Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08065), Chaplot et al, 2018.
