Week 9 - Human-Machine Dialogue Systems
---------------------------------------

In which we discuss neural network systems for holding a conversation and answering questions.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of the session the student will be able to:

*   describe the general architecture of conversational agents
*   outline the processing that takes place in neural speech recognition and neural speech synthesis systems.
*   describe a neural system for the conversion of text to logical forms
*   outline how questions can be answered using a knowledge base
*   use Keras to implement a simple automated assistant.

### Outline

1.  History of dialogue systems
2.  Dialogue system architecture
3.  Designing and imlementing dialogue systems
4.  Generating answers to question using a knowledge base
5.  Semantic parsing

### Research Paper of the Week

*   A. Venkatesh, _et al_, [On Evaluating and Comparing Open Domain Dialog Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.03625.pdf), NIPS Workshop Conversational AI, 2017.

### Web Resources

*   [Get started with the Alexa Skills Kit](https://developer.amazon.com/en-GB/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/start), learn how to give Alexa a new skill.

### Readings

Be sure to read one or more of these discussions of dialogue system construction:

*   [The Turing Test](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-test/). Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.
*   [A survey on human machine dialogue systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7785371), Mallios, Bourbakis, 2016.
