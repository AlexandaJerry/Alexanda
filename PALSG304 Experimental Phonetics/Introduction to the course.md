Introduction to the course
--------------------------

### Aims

The aims of this module are to introduce essential knowledge and skills in experimental phonetics. The course will include hands-on experience of speech recording and speech analysis, the design of experiments, and an introduction to some current scientific theories of speech production.

### Outcomes

After completing the module, participants should be in a better position to:

*   to design simple experiments in phonetics using instrumental methods.
*   to apply modern signal analysis techniques to topical problems in phonetics.
*   to perform simple statistical analyses on experimental data collected to test a phonetic hypothesis.
*   to write a scientific paper describing the results of an experiment.
*   to discuss some topical issues in modern phonetic science research.

### Syllabus

The [syllabus](syllabus.php) covers a range of analysis techniques applied to phonetic data. It looks at the creation of speech corpora, the measurement of timing, rhythm, voice quality, voice pitch, intonation, vowels and syllables. It considers how experimental methods can be used to study phonetic variation according to context, speaker, speaking style, emotion and accent.

### Lectures, Labs & Tutorials

Each week a lecture is used to introduce a particular topic – giving an overview of the current understanding of the field on the topic. This is followed by a practical session in which the students make and analyze recordings in the teaching laboratory. Each session closes with a tutorial in which the learning objectives for the session are reviewed.

### Assessment

#### PALS3009 Laboratory Methods in Phonetics and Speech Science

Assessment for PALS3009 is an experimental research paper based on one of the data sets analysed in the laboratory. Word limit 3000 words. Full details on Moodle site.

Students may submit a draft of their research paper by email to the module co-ordinator no later than two-weeks in advance of the deadline to obtain high-level feedback on content and structure.

Submission dates are as follows:

<table><tbody><tr><th>Date Set</th><th>Draft Paper Due</th><th>Feedback Due</th><th>Final Paper Due</th></tr><tr><td>5 February</td><td>12 March</td><td>19 March</td><td>16 April</td></tr></tbody></table>

Final assessments must be submitted in electronic format through the Moodle site.

#### PALSG304 Experimental Phonetics

Assessment for PALSG304 is divided between an experimental research paper based on one of the data sets analysed in the laboratory (2500 words, 50%), and an unseen written examination (2 hours, 50%) in May. Full details on Moodle site.

Students may submit a draft of their research paper by email to the module co-ordinator no later than two-weeks in advance of the deadline to obtain high-level feedback on content and structure.

Submission dates are as follows:

<table><tbody><tr><th>Date Set</th><th>Draft Paper Due</th><th>Feedback Due</th><th>Final Paper Due</th></tr><tr><td>5 February</td><td>12 March</td><td>19 March</td><td>26 March</td></tr></tbody></table>

Final assessments must be submitted in electronic format through the Moodle site.

### Teaching & Learning Support

A moodle site for this course can be found at: http://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=11489

The site contains readings, lecture handouts, web resources and a discussion forum.

### Handbook

The course handbook is written as a set of web pages and can be found at: [http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/courses/spsci/expphon/](http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/courses/spsci/expphon/).

The web design used for the course handbook is designed to be readable on portable devices.

### Self-Study

The course notes will index a range of web sites containing useful information about the topics. Use these to help develop your understanding of the concepts covered.

Each week a small number of readings will be set. Students should strive to read as much as possible around the topics covered on the course. Readings will be described as "Essential" or "Background". Where possible, essential readings will be made available on-line.

The course notes also contain a 'Reflections' heading which you can use to test your understanding of the material. If you are confused by any of these, bring your questions to the tutorial.

Use the Moodle Discussion forum for any specific questions you have outside the tutorial time. Also post messages if you find other interesting web sites relevant to the course.
