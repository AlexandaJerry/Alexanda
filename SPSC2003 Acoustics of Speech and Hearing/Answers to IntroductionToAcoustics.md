_On this page you will find the answers to the exercises in the booklet '[Introduction to Acoustics](/courses/msc/IntroductionToAcoustics.pdf)', Fifth Edition by Mark Huckvale._

Chapter One
-----------

1. Fill in the blanks:

1.  The frequency of a periodic event is measured in **hertz**.
2.  An event that repeats 1000 times per second has a frequency of **1kHz**.
3.  The density of air is about **1kgm−3**.
4.  An event that repeats 10,000 times per second has a period of **100µs**.
5.  5cm is **5x10−2m** = **0.05m**.

2. Express the following in scientific notation to three significant figures:

1.  61743 = **6.17 x 104**
2.  20000 = **2.00 x 104**
3.  0.02 = **2.00 x 10−2**
4.  1/500 = **2.00 x 10−3**
5.  1/0.05 = **2.00 x 101**
6.  2556 x 10−4 = **2.56 x 10−1**
7.  0.0564 x 10 = **5.64 x 103**

3. Simplify the following:

1.  104 x 105 = **109**
2.  104 x 10-3 = **101**
3.  10−6 x 103 x 10 = **10−2**
4.  101 ÷ 10−3 = **104**

Chapter Two
-----------

1. Given the following (approximate) logarithms to base 10:

log(2) = 0.3; log(3) = 0.48; log(4) = 0.6; log(5) 0.7

Find approximate solutions to the following sums without using a calculator:

1.  log(100) = **2**
2.  log(0.01) = **−2**
3.  100 = **1**
4.  100.3 = **2**
5.  log(6) = **0.3 + 0.48 = 0.78**
6.  log(0.25) = **−log(4) = −0.6**
7.  log(2/3) = **0.3 − 0.48 = −0.18**
8.  101.7 = **101 x 100.7 = 50**

2. The following measurements were made from a straight line graph:

When X is 0, Y = 12

Change in Y for 4 units along the X axis = 3.2

1.  What is the equation of the line?
    
    **Y = 0.8X + 12**
    
2.  What is the value of Y when X is 20?
    
    **28**
    
3.  What is the value of X when Y is 20?
    
    **10**
    

Chapter Three
-------------

1. How much chocolate would I need to spread over a 1m2 surface to generate a pressure underneath of 1Pa? (assume g=10ms−2) If I spread that amount of chocolate over 1/20 of the area, how does the pressure change?

***   Pressure = Force / Area
*   Force = Mass x Acceleration
*   Therefore: Mass = Pressure x Area / Acceleration
*   Mass = 1 x 1 / 10 = 0.1kg
*   Reducing the area by 20 increases the pressure by 20 for a fixed size force.**

2. Winding a grandfather clock involves lifting a weight of 250g up a distance of 0.8m. Taking the acceleration due to gravity (g) to be 10ms−2, how much more energy does the fully wound clock have over the fully unwound one?

***   Energy = Force x Distance
*   Force = Mass x Acceleration
*   Therefore: Energy = Mass x Acceleration x Distance
*   Energy = 0.25 x 0.8 x 10 = 2J**

3. If the intensity of a sound at 2m from the source is 10Wm−2 , what would be the intensity at 6m from the source if the energy was radiated equally in all directions? (Hint: the total power at 2m is distributed over the surface of a sphere of radius 2m, but the total power at 6m is distributed over the surface of a sphere of radius 6m).

***   Intensity = Power / Area
*   Power = Intensity x Area
*   Call the area of the sphere at 2m = A
*   Then Power = 10W x A
*   When sphere grows to 6m, radius increases by x3
*   But Area increases by x9 = 9 x A
*   Therefore Intensity at 6m = (10W x A) / (9 x A) = 1.1W
*   Intensity falls as the square of the distance to the source: this is called the _inverse square law_.**
