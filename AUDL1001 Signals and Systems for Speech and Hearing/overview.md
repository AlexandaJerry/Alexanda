AUDL 1001   Autumn 2011
=======================

Signals and Systems for Speech and Hearing  

---------------------------------------------

#### Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences  
Division of Psychology & Language Sciences, UCL  
Chandler House  
2 Wakefield Street  
London WC1N 1PF  

This unit will present the concepts of signals and systems analysis that play a role in hearing and speech science. Emphasis is on the conceptual underpinnings of the area, through a primarily graphical approach, as opposed to the ability to do explicit mathematical calculations. These concepts are essential for understanding of many areas in hearing and speech science, including the functioning of the auditory system, the acoustic structure of speech, and the operating principles of auditory prostheses, including cochlear implants. Topics will include: the notion of a signal & system; decibels; the frequency characterization of signals & systems (spectra and transfer functions); the temporal characterization of signals & systems (waveforms and impulse responses); signals through systems; digital signals & systems.

**Course Structure:**

The course is run in the first term only, on Monday afternoons, starting on 3 October 2011.

There is no meeting on 7 November due to it being reading week.

Each three-hour session will start with a lecture, and will comprise a varying mix of lecture, demonstrations, lab sessions and tutorials.

Venue and scheduling:

The lecture starts at 14:00 in Room G15 on the ground floor of

[Chandler House](http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/dept/maps.html)

. Some of the teaching will also take place on other floors of the same building.

**Required text:**

Rosen, S., and Howell, P. (2010).

_[Signals and Systems for Speech and Hearing, 2nd edition](http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/stuart/S&S_2010.html)_

: Emerald Press, London. Chapters 11-14 in this new edition are significantly different from the earlier one. The syllabus for this unit is based on this book, with exercises and assigned reading for you to complete in it. It is more or less essential for you to own your own copy, and will also prove useful in other parts of the BSc Audiology course.

**Supplementary Reading**

Speaks, C. E. (1999).

_Introduction to Sound_

. 3rd edition. Chapman and Hall. ISBN: 1565939794.

This book is very readable and is aimed at students with little background knowledge of mathematics and physics. Each concept is introduced in non-mathematical terms before the corresponding mathematics is introduced. The explanations of exponents, logarithms and decibels are particularly good but more advanced topics are covered very sketchily with, at least in the 2nd edition, some serious misconceptions. See

[here](Review%20of%20Speaks%201996.pdf)

for a review.

Haughton, P.M. (2002).

_Acoustics For Audiologists_

. Academic Press. ISBN: 0123329221.

A book more grounded in physics, which could also be of help in aspects of Auditory Biophysics. Can be quite tough going, though.

**Requisite background**

We assume that you are already familiar with basic mathematical concepts like exponents, and the use of graphs. The booklet

[An Introduction to Acoustics](http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/courses/msc/IntroductionToAcoustics.pdf)

with

[answers](http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/courses/spsci/acoustics/introanswers.htm)

may also prove useful.

**Assessment for BSc Audiology**

4 problem sets (5% each), distributed throughout the 10 weeks (see below). These will mostly be marked during the teaching session at which they are handed in so you must be present to receive a grade!

3-hour written paper (80%) in the main exam period of Term III.

**_You must pass the final exam to pass the course._**

**Assessment for all the MSc courses**

A weighted average of the 4 problem sets, distributed throughout the 10 weeks (see below), will form 10% of your grade. These will mostly be marked during the teaching session at which they are handed in so you must be present to receive a grade!

A 2-hour written paper (80%) in the main exam period of Term III, also covering aspects of auditory biophysics.

*   [lab handout - frequency response of a resonator](Week 3 lab frequency response 2011.pdf)

Exercises:

*   Work through Chapters 5 & 6 (Don't worry too much about the phase response of systems, but you do need to understand the concept of a cascade and calculating the total response from the individual ones)

===================================

Teaching Material:

*   [lab handout - signals through systems](Week 5 lab signals thru systems.pdf)

Exercises:  

*   Do the quiz on page 5 of the lab handout from last week (harmonic spectra). 'Ratio' refers simply to the specified level of Pa divided by 20 µPa. In section C, ensure you convert the levels to µPa before you do the division. Then, take the log base 10 of that ratio and multiply by 20 to get the level in dB SPL. Also, ignore the extra use of the word 'Ratio'. All you are really meant to do is calculate the level of the component in dB SPL!
*   Read Chapter  8: Do the following exercises (pp. 163-165): 

*   Exercise 1: It will probably be easier for you if you draw the input spectrum of the sawtooth first. 
*   Exercise 2. 
*   Exercise 3. Remember, all these measurements relate to a single LTI system.
*   Exercise 4
*   Exercise 6. Assume that the fundamental component in both the input and output spectra has a level of 1 V.
