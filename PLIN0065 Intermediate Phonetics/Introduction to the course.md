Introduction to the course
--------------------------

### Aims

To discuss fundamental theoretical and empirical questions arising from the scientific study of spoken linguistic communication. To provide participants with hands-on experience of analysing phonetic data. To introduce modern experimental techniques in the study of Phonetics and modern applications of Phonetic science.

### Outcomes

After completing the module, participants should be in a better position to:

*   understand the primary literature in phonetics and phonology
*   employ basic experimental methods in the analysis of phonetic data
*   write up reports on experimental and analytical work in phonetics and phonology

### Syllabus

The syllabus covers essential topics in Phonetics, including: the domain of Phonetics, principles of Phonetic analysis, speech acoustics, quantitative assessment of phonation and pitch, acoustic characterisation of vowels and consonants, sound sequences and suprasegmentals, paralinguistic phenomena, speaker characterisation.

### Lectures, Labs & Tutorials

Each week the course will offer the student: 1.5 hours of pre-recorded lecture videos; 1.5 hours of lecture Q&A, activities, and tutorial; 1 hour tutorial class. The timetable slots are longer than these estimates, which will leave time for additional discussion (if needed) without clashing with other modules. Lecture videos will be made available during the week **before** the content is discussed, allowing the student enough time to digest the lecture content, post questions on the weekly Moodle Q&A forum, and come prepared for content discussion.

### Assessment

Assessment is through two 1500 word essays/lab-reports. These will be based around topics that have been covered in the lectures and will incorporate data collected from activities in the laboratory. You will have an opportunity to submit a practice lab report to get feedback on style in advance of the first assessment.

The provisional dates are as follows:

<table><tbody><tr><th>Title</th><th>Date Set</th><th>Date Due</th></tr><tr><td>Practice</td><td>24 October</td><td>4 November</td></tr><tr><td>Assessment 1</td><td>12 November</td><td>23 November</td></tr><tr><td>Assessment 2</td><td>3 December</td><td>11 January</td></tr></tbody></table>

Assessments must be submitted in electronic format through the Moodle site before midnight.

### Moodle

The course has a moodle page at [https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=7157](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=7157).

The Moodle site will contain links to pre-recorded lecture videos, course notes, lecture slides, and additional resources.

### Handbook

The course handbook is written as a set of web pages and can be found at: [http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/courses/plin0065/](http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/courses/plin0065/).

The web design used for the course handbook is designed to be readable on portable devices. Course notes can also be converted for the [Kindle e-book reader](https://amzn.to/2ORpoGg) using an application such as [klip.me](http://www.klip.me).

Course notes will **not** be printed. They contain many web links and interactive multimedia that are lost on printing. If you require a printed version you will need to print them yourself.

### Self-Study

The course notes will index a range of web sites containing useful information about the topics. Use these to help develop your understanding of the concepts covered.

Each week a small number of readings will be set. Students should strive to read as much as possible around the topics covered on the course. Readings will be described as "Essential" or "Background". Where possible, essential readings will be made available on-line.

The course notes also contain a 'Reflections' heading which you can use to test your understanding of the material. **You should make sure you are able to answer these questions before you come to the tutorial session.** If you are confused by any of these, bring your questions to the tutorial.

Use the Moodle Discussion forum for any specific questions you have outside the tutorial time. Also post messages if you find other interesting web sites relevant to the course.

### Text Books

No single text book covers all the material included in the course at an appropriate level of description. The following are recommended and all are available in the Language Sciences Library on the second floor of Chandler House.

If you purchase any of these from Amazon using the supplied links, you will be supporting the web site [www.speechandhearing.net](http://www.speechandhearing.net).

#### Introductory Books

[An Introduction to the Science of Phonetics](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0805856722/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0805856722&linkCode=as2&tag=speechandhear-21)![][img-0] (Nigel Hewlett & Mary Beck, 2006).

A general introduction to articulation, sound, hearing and perception that meshes well with the scientific approach to the material that we take in the course.

[A Course in Phonetics, International Edition (with CD-ROM)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1428231277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1428231277&linkCode=as2&tag=speechandhear-21)![][img-1] (Peter Ladefoged & Keith Johnson, 2010).

A classic text that extends Ladefoged's book'Vowels and Consonants'.

#### Advanced Books

[A Practical Introduction to Phonetics (Oxford Textbooks in Linguistics)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0199246351/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0199246351&linkCode=as2&tag=speechandhear-21)![][img-2] (John Catford, 2001)
