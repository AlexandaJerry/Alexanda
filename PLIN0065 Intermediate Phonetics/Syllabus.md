Syllabus
--------

Week 1 - Domain of Phonetics

In which we discuss what constitutes the study of Phonetics and consider its relationship to other areas such as Phonology, Speech & Hearing Science and Speech technology.

Week 2 - Principles of Phonetics

In which we discuss the principles behind the phonetic description of speech with particular focus on the character and limitations of phonetic transcription.

Week 3 - Sound initiation in the vocal tract

In which we look at the mechanisms by which sound is generated and shaped in the vocal apparatus and how we can characterise sounds using spectra and spectrograms.

Week 4 - Phonation

In which we look at the production of voice in the larynx and the description and measurement of voice quality.

Week 5 - Sonorants

In which we study the phonetic and acoustic character of resonant articulations.

Week 6 - Obstruents

In which we study the phonetic and acoustic character of obstruent articulations and their perception by listeners.

Week 7 - Sequences

In which we study how speech sounds change when executed in sequences.

Week 8 - Suprasegmentals

In which we look at the phonetic effects that operate over domains larger than the individual segment.

Week 9 - Paralinguistics

In which we look at the impact of speaking style, stress and emotion on the character of speech.

Week 10 - Speakers and accents

In which we look at how speakers may be identified or characterised by the way they speak.
